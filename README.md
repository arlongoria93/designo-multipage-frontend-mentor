## Overview

I crafted a dynamic and responsive 7-page website by harnessing the power of Next.js and the flexibility of Tailwind CSS. Employing a mobile-first approach, I ensured seamless user experiences across devices. Taking precision to the next level, I meticulously translated Figma design files into real-world layouts and styling, achieving pixel-perfect results that mirror the envisioned aesthetic.

To enhance the website's functionality, I integrated the Leaflet API, seamlessly weaving real-time location data into interactive maps. This feature empowers users to explore and engage with the map, elevating the website's overall interactivity. The amalgamation of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Leaflet API resulted in a harmonious symphony of technology, design, and functionality, culminating in a captivating and user-centered digital experience.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

### What I learned

I gained valuable insights into optimizing styling processes by discovering new and efficient Tailwind CSS techniques. This newfound knowledge significantly accelerated and simplified the styling aspect of web development. Additionally, I honed my skills in effectively implementing Next.js' new app router layout, particularly in the context of smaller projects. This proficiency empowered me to create more streamlined and well-structured web applications while maximizing the benefits of Next.js' routing capabilities.

### Continued development

In my pursuit of ongoing growth, I am committed to enhancing the website's accessibility by implementing a strategic approach. This involves encapsulating content within HTML landmarks, thereby optimizing navigation and user experience for individuals using assistive technologies.

To streamline and standardize the design process, I aim to transcend the manual input of color codes and font sizes. My strategy involves transforming these design attributes into reusable variables, seamlessly integrated within Tailwind CSS's configuration. This not only promotes consistency across the website but also expedites the styling process by centralizing these attributes for easy modification and widespread application. This evolution will empower me to efficiently manage design elements and expedite the development of future projects while maintaining a cohesive and professional aesthetic.
